## Examples for the Strategy level

First we brainstorm the product objectives. What do we want this product (the web site) to accomplish? The objectives we choose should, as this site is linked to a bricks & mortar store, align with the objectives for our off-line business.

Then we consider the user and think carefully about her needs with regard to both the web site itself and the caf√© and roastery it represents. How can the site meet these needs? Again, this is about brainstorming. These user needs will be refined and redefined iteratively as we develop the actual site based on user testing, user feedback, new ideas, and changing requirements.
