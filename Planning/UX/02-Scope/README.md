##Examples for the Scope level

Now we'll convert our user needs and product objectives into a set of actions that users will take on our site. We can express these actions&mdash;which will become features&mdash; in the form of "job stories" or "user stories".

See the resources below for links to information about how to write job or user stories.

- [Job stories](/review/02-scope/job-stories.md)
- [User stories](/review/02-scope/user-stories.md)

You were expected to do one or the other, not both (but it's OK if you tried both).
