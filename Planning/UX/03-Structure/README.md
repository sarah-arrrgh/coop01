# Examples for the Structure level

For this part of the site (the initial MVP), we're going to use a hierarchical structure. This is the most common type of structure for a web site. Almost ever site has at least some hierarchy to it.

We've drawn out our structure using the Garrett Information Architecture Visual Vocabulary. We found a [good guide](http://boxesandarrows.com/site-diagrams-mapping-an-information-space/). We've kept it simple in keeping with our MVP.

Take a look. How does your diagram differ? Which do you like better?
