# Examples for the skeleton level

We've put together a few examples of quick wireframes. These show how we would sketch up a basic skeleton for our Impresso web site.

Try your hand at a few site pages. Sketching on paper is fine if you're not too familiar with modeling tools. You can also check out [draw.io](http://draw.io/).
