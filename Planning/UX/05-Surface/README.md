# Examples for the Surface level

We made a start on a wireframe prototype for our MVP. It's very rough, but the primary page sections are there.

We've left it as an exercise for you to update the pages. What will the Events page include? What will individual Event pages look like? How does the location page work with the map?

(For a wireframe, just take a screenshot of the map and stick it in the page as we did. Save the connection to Google mpas for the real app.)

For our user testing, we wouldn't bother to update the privacy or terms pages, but we'd probably add a non-working form to the contact page, a non-working map (and data) to the location page, and something menu-like to the menu page. Then we'd start testing.

View the code in the `impresso` folder in here. If you have python installed on your computer, you can `cd` into that folder in your terminal and run:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```

which will start an HTTP server (web server) in that folder. Then if you point your browser to `http://localhost:3000/` you should see the application. Try this.
